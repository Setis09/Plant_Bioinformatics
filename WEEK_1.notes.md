# INTRODUCTION
 MODULE TOPIC:
 1. Plant Genome DBs and useful sites for protein information
 2. Expression analysis
 3. Coexpression Tools
 4. Promoter analysis
 5. Functional classification and pathway visualization
 6. Network Exploration (PPIs, PDIs, GRNs)

WHAT IS BIOINFORMATICS:
- Development and application of computational tools in managing all kinds of biological data
- Storeage, retrieval, manipulation and distribution of information of macromolecules.

## Plant Biological DBs

### Why plant biological DBs?
- Search for function of interest genes
  - Under what conditions the genes is expressed
  - The gene of interest have mutations?
  - Why is the molecular netwok in which my gene of interest participates?
  - Have to protein post transcriptional modifications?

### Databases of A. thaliana and other plants
- https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp  (TAIR) -> Search for genes and functions
- https://www.araport.org/ and then "ThaleMine link" (ARAPORT) -> Search for genes and functions
- https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html (EnsemblPlants) -> Phylogenies, functions, and positions
- http://suba.live/ (SUBA4) -> Subcellular localization database
- http://bar.utoronto.ca/cell_efp/cgi-bin/cell_efp.cgi (Cell eFP Browser) -> Subcellular localization database
- PLAZA V3 and PLAZA V4 (PLAZA) -> Presents information from many databases. So, it allows to see phylogenetic tree, protein family tree
- POLYMORPH 1001 -> Identify SNPs polymorphisms or insertions, deletions in particular genes.
