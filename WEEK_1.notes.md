 MODULE TOPIC:
 1. Plant Genome DBs and useful sites for protein information
 2. Expression analysis
 3. Coexpression Tools
 4. Promoter analysis
 5. Functional classification and pathway visualization
 6. Network Exploration (PPIs, PDIs, GRNs)

WHAT IS BIOINFORMATICS:
- Development and application of computational tools in managing all kinds of biological data
- Storeage, retrieval, manipulation and distribution of information of macromolecules.

## Plant Biological DBs

### Why plant biological DBs?
- Search for function of interest genes
  - Under what conditions the genes is expressed
  - The gene of interest have mutations?
  - Why is the molecular netwok in which my gene of interest participates?
  - Have to protein post transcriptional modifications?

### Databases of A. thaliana and other plants
- https://www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp  (TAIR)
- https://www.araport.org/ and then "ThaleMine link" (ARAPORT)
- https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html (EnsemblPlants)
- http://suba.live/ (SUBA4) -> Subcellular localization database
- http://bar.utoronto.ca/cell_efp/cgi-bin/cell_efp.cgi (Cell eFP Browser) -> Subcellular localization database
